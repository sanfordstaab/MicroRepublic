# MicroRepublic
A website to replace government

Basic idea:
   A website that creates a social network that allows:
   1) Calling of juries to do the work of the republic
   2) A self checking secure database that any member may copy or get a signature snapshot of to check data integrety or reproduce the republic should it become damaged.
   3) User validation using witnesses and biometric data
   4) Management of documents.
   5) A secure internal email system
   6) Management of jury cases and trials.
